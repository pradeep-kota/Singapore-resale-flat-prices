# Singapore-resale-flat-prices
Predict the resale values of Singapore flats using input values like month, town, flat_type, block, street_name, storey_range, floor_area_sqm, flat_model, lease_commence_date, remaining_lease. Flat prices also depends on lot other factors which we might add in future.

### Motivation:
The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, and it can be challenging to accurately estimate the resale value of a flat. There are many factors that can affect resale prices, such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. A predictive model can help to overcome these challenges by providing users with an estimated resale price based on these factors.

### The project will involve the following tasks:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to Till Date. Preprocess the data to clean and structure it for machine learning..
2. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date. Create any additional features that may enhance prediction accuracy.
3. Model Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or random forests). Train the model on the historical data, using a portion of the dataset for training.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's predictive performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R2 Score.
5. Streamlit Web Application: Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to input details of a flat (town, flat type, storey range, etc.). Utilize the trained machine learning model to predict the resale price based on user inputs.
6. Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure it functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.

### Results: 
The project will benefit both potential buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market. Buyers can use the application to estimate resale prices and make informed decisions, while sellers can get an idea of their flat's potential market value. Additionally, the project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in real estate and web development.

Contributiont to this project is welcome and can fork and add branches with my approval too. This is my starting phase of ML/AI and will contribute more to the society ahead.
